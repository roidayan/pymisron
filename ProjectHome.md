Why to use a gateway and not connect the icq servers?
because this way its possible to use the limited free gprs/wap connections which allow connections to http ports only.

Why to use a tool and not the web browser and use an some php page ?
because the tool will let you choose a number from your contacts.

current gateway used is http://misron.net/

that gateway is scripted in a way only numbers in israel will work.
sorry for the other for now.
i'll upload a gateway somewhere later.
if someone want to host a php script for the gateway let me know.


  * You will need PythonForS60, you can get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60.
